# 🛒 Electronics store – Full-Stack Web Platform

## 📌 Project Overview
This project was developed as part of a group academic project at **Polytech Nancy (IA2R – computer science, Automation, Robotics and Networks)**.  
The objective was to design and implement a secure full-stack web platform for managing an electronics store, including product catalog, orders, customers, and stock.

A strong focus was placed on **security, authentication, and system architecture**, aligning with modern industry practices.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Design and implement a scalable and secure web application.
- Apply full-stack development best practices.
- Integrate strong authentication and access control.
- Work collaboratively in a team environment using Git.
- Ensure data integrity and system security.

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture
The system follows a **layered architecture**:

- **Frontend**: Angular
- **Backend**: Spring Boot (RESTful APIs)
- **Security**: Spring Security with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- **Database**: Relational database (SQL)
- **Version control**: GitLab and GitHub

## 🔐 Security Features
Security was a central component of this project. We implemented:

- Authentication and authorization using **Spring Security**
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Secure password storage
- Session management
- Protection against common web vulnerabilities:
  - SQL Injection
  - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  - Unauthorized access

This project strengthened my interest in **cybersecurity and secure system design**.

## ⚙️ Key Functionalities
- User authentication and registration
- Secure login with MFA
- Product and category management
- Order and payment management
- Customer and supplier management
- Inventory and stock tracking
- Role-based access (admin, user, etc.)
